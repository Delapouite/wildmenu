<p>Bill Joy created vi using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A">ADM-3A terminal</a>. Its keyboard has distinct features that heavily influenced vi design.</p>

<p>The <kbd>ESC</kbd> was located in place of the actual <kbd>TAB</kbd> key. Below, the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> key was placed instead of the <kbd>CAPS-LOCK</kbd> key.</p>

<p>Each <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd> and <kbd>l</kbd> key was labelled with the arrows we know and love.</p>

<p>Finally, on the top right corner, the <kbd>Home</kbd> key was also the <kbd>~</kbd> key.</p>
