<p>Dealing with text encoding is always a lot of fun, isn't it? If you answered a big "NO", the following tip might save your ass one day.</p>
<p>I once stumbled upon a condition almost like this one <code>"hérésie" == "hérésie"</code> and had a very hard time figuring out why this code returned <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Every time you have to handle words in foreign locales, especially when it comes from another platform, you immediately suspect something might goes wrong. And in this scenario the <code>é</code> was indeed the culprit.</p>
<p>Your eyes can't really help you to unveil the fallacy. You must inspect the ASCII code with powerful tools. Like <kbd>ga</kbd></p>
<p>By using this shortcut for <cmd>ascii</cmd> on the <code>é</code> chars on the left hand side nothing weird was printed : <code><é> 233, Hex 00e9, Octal 351</code>.</p>
<p>However, <kbd>ga</kbd> printed me another story for the ones on the right hand side: <code>&lt;e&gt; 101, Hex 65, Octal 145 < > 769, Hex 0301, Octal 1401.</code></p>
<p>So while the first occurrences where legit <code>é</code>, the other ones where composed chars from a normal <kbd>e</kbd> combined with an acute accent!</p>
