<p>The <kbd>⇟ Page Down</kbd> key is often hard to reach without leaving the <a href="#home-row">home row</a> or even absent on some laptop keyboards.</p>
<p>To scroll the window downwards, here are a few other chords:<p>

<ul>
  <li><kbd>CTRL-f</kbd> → down a full screen</li>
  <li><kbd>CTRL-d</kbd> → down a half screen</li>
  <li><kbd>CTRL-e</kbd> → down the number of lines you specified as count</li>
</ul>

<p>This triad is composed of 3 consecutive letters so it's an easy way to remember them.</p>

<p>Guess how to go <a href="#up">the opposite direction</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to go down, you may be diving to the bottom! See how to jump to the <a href="#bottom-window">bottom of the window</a> and the <a href="#bottom-buffer">bottom of the buffer</a>.</p>
